# Counter App

This is a simple web app that allows you to count up or down, and save your counts for later.

## Installation

There is no installation required to use this app. Simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

## Usage

To use the app, simply click the "INCREMENT" or "DECREMENT" button to increase or decrease the count. You can also click the "RESET" button to reset the count to zero.

To save your count, click the "SAVE" button. If you haven't incremented or decremented the count at least once, you will see an error message. If you have already saved the current count, you will also see an error message.

To view your previous counts, click the "PREVIOUS ENTRIES" button. This will display a list of all the counts you have saved. You can clear this list by clicking the "CLEAR ENTRIES" button.
